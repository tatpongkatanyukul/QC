# QC

See what I planed for [C in Q wonderland](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/AdventureBook/blob/main/CinQWonder/readme.md)

## Quantum Mechanics Properties leading to QC:
  * Superposition
  * Collapse of states
  * Entanglement
  * Decoherence
  * Quantum tunneling

## How these properties are used to make QC (or become issues in QC)


### Creating quantum properties

  * Hadamard gate: superposition
  * Hadamard and CNOT gates: entanglement
 

## How QC is implemented


## QC: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats


## QC algorithm

### Search

#### Glover Algorithm


### Optimization

### Machine Learning


## QC fault-tolerance and error correction
