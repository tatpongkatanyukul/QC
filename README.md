# QC

## Quantum Mechanics Properties leading to QC:
  * Superposition
  * Collapse of states
  * Entanglement
  * Decoherence
  * Quantum tunneling

## How these properties are used to make QC (or become issues in QC)


### Creating quantum properties

  * Hadamard gate: superposition
  * Hadamard and CNOT gates: entanglement
